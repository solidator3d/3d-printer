Solidator 3+ features a massive build volume of 345 x 194 x 400 mm (13.61” x 7.65" x 15.75") and provides Z resolutions between 30-100 micron with a 90 micron XY resolution. It features an automatic refill system capable of working with 5 kg canisters. This newest version of the printer increased the build speed further by 20% to 2363 cm³/hour (144 in³/hour) with the Solidator Functional Resin which is extremely strong (Ultimate Strength 9572 psi). The Solidator Functional Resin is much stronger, stiffer and more scratch-resistant than polyamide (PA12) used in SLS, while still offering enough impact resistance and flexibility for snap-fit applications and an excellent smooth finish. It is now also the material with the highest build speed on the Solidator 3+. The available materials target usage of the printer in engineering, industrial end-use parts, architecture and dental applications.
